# Case Study in Mathematical Modelling

This is a group project from the MSc in MMSC, focussed on battery modelling.

## A Journal of the Journey

### Week 1:

- introductory meeting and presentation of available projects

### Week 2:

- Tuesday: first meeting with Robert
- Write a code to solve the ODE with "i" profile as input
- Derive equations (fitting or approximate functions) for all variables to be included in the code later
- write the exact solution of the equation by hand (check if code solution is similar)
- find out how usually input is given and find a few input profiles that are interesting to examine

### Week 1:
